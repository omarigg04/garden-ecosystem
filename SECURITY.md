# üîê Security Guide - Digital Ecosystem Garden

## üìã Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data and payment information in the Digital Ecosystem Garden.

## üõ°Ô∏è Payment Security (Stripe)

### ‚úÖ What's Already Secure:

**Stripe Handles All Sensitive Data:**
- Credit card numbers, CVV, expiration dates ‚Üí **NEVER** touch our servers
- PCI DSS compliance ‚Üí Stripe's responsibility
- Payment processing ‚Üí Handled by Stripe Checkout
- Secure tokens ‚Üí Generated and managed by Stripe

**Our Application Only Stores:**
- Public session IDs (safe to store)
- Transaction amounts (public information)
- Donor emails (for entity creation)
- Payment status (completed/pending/failed)

### üîí Additional Security Measures:

#### 1. Email Privacy Protection

**Option A: Email Hashing (recommended for privacy)**
```typescript
// Hash emails in donations collection for privacy
const hashedEmail = hashEmail(email);
```

**Option B: Keep Plain Email (recommended for functionality)**
```typescript
// Keep plain email for customer support and entity linking
const email = session.customer_email;
```

**Recommendation:** Use plain emails for better user experience and customer support capabilities.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Security (Appwrite)

### Collection Permissions:

#### `entities` Collection:
```
Create: any (for webhook creation)
Read: any (public ecosystem viewing)
Update: users (for behavior updates)
Delete: admins (for moderation)
```

#### `donations` Collection (RESTRICTED):
```
Create: API key only (webhook exclusive)
Read: admins only (payment data is private)
Update: API key only (status updates)
Delete: admins only (compliance)
```

#### `structures` Collection:
```
Create: users (for building features)
Read: any (public ecosystem viewing)
Update: users (construction progress)
Delete: admins (moderation)
```

### üîê API Key Security:

**Appwrite API Keys:**
- Use separate API keys for different environments
- Restrict API key permissions to minimum required
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Never expose API keys in client-side code

## üåê Application Security

### Environment Variables:

**Required Security Variables:**
```bash
# Stripe (keep secret)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Appwrite (keep secret)
APPWRITE_API_KEY=...

# OpenAI (keep secret)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional encryption (for additional security)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-key
EMAIL_SALT=your-random-salt
```

### üö® Never Commit to Git:
- API keys and secrets
- Encryption keys
- Production environment variables
- Real Stripe keys

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Webhook Security:

**Stripe Webhook Validation:**
```typescript
// Always validate webhook signatures
const event = constructWebhookEvent(body, signature);
```

**IP Allowlisting (optional):**
- Restrict webhook endpoints to Stripe IPs
- Use reverse proxy for additional protection

### Logging and Monitoring:

**Log These Events:**
- Failed webhook attempts
- Unusual payment patterns
- Database access errors
- API rate limiting

**Don't Log:**
- Full payment details
- Raw API keys
- User personal information beyond necessary

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Recommendations

### Current Security Level: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

The current implementation is secure for production because:

1. **No sensitive payment data stored** in our database
2. **Stripe handles all PCI compliance**
3. **Webhook signature validation** prevents tampering
4. **Environment variables** protect API keys
5. **Appwrite permissions** control data access

### Optional Enhancements:

#### For High-Privacy Requirements:
```typescript
// 1. Hash email addresses in donations collection
email: hashEmail(originalEmail)

// 2. Encrypt additional metadata
metadata: encryptSensitiveData(JSON.stringify(data))

// 3. Use UUID instead of sequential IDs
entityId: crypto.randomUUID()
```

#### For Enterprise Security:
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add request logging and monitoring
- Use webhook IP allowlisting
- Implement session management
- Add CSRF protection for admin interfaces

## üìä Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance:
- **Right to be forgotten:** Allow users to delete their data
- **Data portability:** Provide user data export
- **Consent management:** Track user consent for data processing
- **Data minimization:** Only collect necessary data

### PCI DSS:
- **Not applicable** - No card data stored
- **Stripe handles compliance** for payment processing

## üö® Security Checklist for Production

### Before Deployment:

- [ ] Replace all test API keys with production keys
- [ ] Generate strong encryption keys (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configure Appwrite permissions correctly
- [ ] Set up webhook signature validation
- [ ] Test webhook endpoints with Stripe CLI
- [ ] Configure environment variables on hosting platform
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review database collection permissions
- [ ] Test API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed payments

### Regular Security Maintenance:

- [ ] Rotate API keys quarterly
- [ ] Monitor webhook logs for anomalies
- [ ] Review database access logs
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Audit user permissions

## üìû Security Incident Response

### If Suspicious Activity Detected:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable affected API keys
   - Check webhook logs
   - Review recent database changes
   - Contact Stripe support if needed

2. **Investigation:**
   - Identify scope of potential breach
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Review access logs
   - Document findings

3. **Response:**
   - Notify affected users if required
   - Update security measures
   - Report to authorities if required by law
   - Implement additional monitoring

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The current security implementation is robust and production-ready.** Additional encryption is optional and may complicate the user experience without significant security benefits, since no truly sensitive data (like payment details) is stored in our database.

**Focus on operational security:** Proper API key management, webhook validation, and access controls provide the most important protection for this application.
